        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>More advanced schooling helps. If you can avoid the crushing debt of student loans, all the better. Try
            to find a major that you're good at and that is good to you.</p>

        <h3>Birthright</h3>
        <p>For accruing wealth, what's even better than education? Being born wealthy. In the graph below, note how
            the birthright high enders are able to become more wealthy than the education high enders. So before
            being born, shop around.</p>
