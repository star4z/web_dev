<h2>Functional programming in Javascript example</h2>
<p>
    The following block of code demonstrates functional programming in JavaScript. The variable <var>books</var> is
    initialized with an array of JavaScript objects, each containing key-value pairs. In the imperative example, we see
    books iterated through the array and adding a new field to each object, which is analogous to the way the computer
    actually executes the code. In the declarative example, <var>books</var> is mapped to a to a function which returns

<pre><code>
    var books = [
      {name:'JavaScript', pages:450},
      {name:'Angular', pages:902},
      {name:'Node', pages:732}
    ];
    /* Imperative Pattern */
    for (var i = 0; i < books.length; i++) {
      books[i].lastRead =  new Date();
    }
    /* Declarative Pattern */
    books.map((book)=> {
      book.lastReadBy = 'me';
      return book;
    });
    console.log(books);
