<h2>Code Example</h2>
<p>
    In the given example, the user is prompted for their name, which is stored in the <var>name</var> variable.
    The code then outputs a greeting to the user.<br>For example, if the user entered <kbd>Michael Mayhew</kbd>, then the
    program would respond with <samp>It&apos;s nice to meet you, Michael Mayhew!</samp>
</p>
<pre><code>
    var name
    name = prompt("Hello! What's your name?")
    alert("It's nice to meet you, " + name + "!")
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
    In JavaScript, variables are declared using the <code><b>var</b></code> keyword. <br>...<br>In order to obtain input from the user, the
    <code><b>prompt()</b></code> function is used. It takes in a string parameter which is displayed, and causes the program to wait
    until it receives input from the user. The function returns the value from the user input as a string.
